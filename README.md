# Linux Console File Explorer (C++17 | WSL)

##  Overview

This project is a *console-based File Explorer* implemented using *C++17* and designed to run inside the *Linux environment (WSL on Windows 11)*.
It replicates many commonly used Linux file-system commands (like ls, cd, cp, mv, rm, chmod, etc.) inside a single C++ application.

The program enables users to browse directories, create/copy/delete files, manage permissions, and search within the Linux filesystem — all through a custom menu-driven console.
